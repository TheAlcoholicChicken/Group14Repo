# Group14Repo

Installation
Pre-requisites: Node.js and Mongo downloaded

1. Go into nodetest1 folder
2. Open cmd prompt
3. 'npm install'
4. 'npm start' to start Node

This will install everything in the packages.json file. This will make the node module folder that is specified in the .gitignore.

For this application to work, you must have Node running, as well as mongod.exe.  NOT mongo.exe, though. 

Open localhost:3000 to view what's there so far.
localhost:3000/newuser  to register yourself in the database.  
If success, it will take you to localhost:3000/userlist and you should be able to see yourself on there.

Make sure to restart Node anytime a change is made in the javascript. No need for Jade, just refresh the page.
