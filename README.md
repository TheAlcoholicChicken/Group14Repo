# Installation
Pre-requisites: Node.js and Mongo downloaded

1. Go into base directory of your repo
2. Open cmd prompt
3. 'npm install'
4. 'npm start' to start Node

This will install everything in the packages.json file. This will make the node module folder that is specified in the .gitignore.

Open localhost:3000 to view what's there so far.

Make sure to login to your mlab to be able to see the database and update in real time. 

Make sure to restart Node anytime a change is made in the javascript. No need for Jade, just refresh the page.
